# VIST-170
Visual Computing Environments

Course Description: Procedures, practices and environments useful for visual problem solving using programmatic languages; setup and use of the computing environment; useful system tools and commands; basic programming concepts and constructs. 

Notes: Aside from the above (and the use of Python specifically, which is versatile for any field), the examples and tasks in class gave some insight into basic workflows for 3D modelling, both in Autodesk Maya specifically and otherwise. 

Run Info: Autodesk Maya Required. While Maya can directly run .py files via Import Script, VS Code and the Mayacode plugin for VSCode (transmit code to Maya) are recommended due to more coding utility vs. Maya's native script editor.
